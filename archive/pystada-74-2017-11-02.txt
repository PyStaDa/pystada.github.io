Agenda
------

* Simple distributed task processing for Python 3: http://dramatiq.io
  * what alternatives exist? how do they compare?
	  * https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/
* "Python is Weird" was a talk at PyCon.DE which I unfortunately missed.
	* I propose we go through the slides and try to understand why the examples work
	* Slides are here: http://www.python-mit.ch/files/dave-halter-python-is-weird.pdf
	* The PyCon video is still not online, but the speaker held the talk before, so we can also watch it together instead of going through the slides: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NVUbO7pFtA
	* Maybe we can tackle the riddle on the last slide: lambda:br''or.6*.3+.4jif.1else-...();float.__int__(eval('_')().imag*100);chr(int(str(_),16)+1)
	
* mentions of old meetings:

* pytest-benchmark 3.1.1               
	* A ``py.test`` fixture for benchmarking code. It will group the tests into rounds that are calibrated to the chosen timer. See calibration_ and FAQ_.

	* One document to learn numerics, science, and data with Python

* A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django
	* https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/
	
* Most python exercises I found online were either too easy or tested things that were not directly related to python (mostly data structures or algorithms).
