    Enough with microservices https://aadrake.com/posts/2017-05-20-enough-with-the-microservices.html

Microservices:
	Do you have big, monolith web applications or services that are hard to manage, hard to change, and hard to scale? Maybe breaking them into microservices would give you many more options to evolve and grow that app.
	
	This week, we meet up again with Miguel Grinberg to discuss the trades offs and advantages of microservices.
